        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Guided learning outcomes are specific, measurable statements that describe what students should know, understand, or be able to do after completing a learning activity or module. They provide clear guidance for both learners and instructors on the intended learning outcomes.</p>
        <p>Guided learning outcomes serve several important purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> They clarify the expectations for students by clearly defining what they are expected to achieve.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> They help focus instructional efforts by identifying the key skills and knowledge that students should acquire.</li>
            <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> They provide a basis for assessing student learning and determining whether the learning objectives have been met.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> They ensure alignment between learning objectives, instructional activities, and assessments, creating a cohesive learning experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When writing guided learning outcomes, it's important to use action verbs that are specific, measurable, and observable. These verbs should describe the desired behaviors or actions that students should demonstrate.</p>
        <p>Additionally, guided learning outcomes should be aligned with course objectives and instructional activities to ensure coherence and relevance.</p>
