        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
        <p>Blended learning, also known as hybrid learning, combines traditional face-to-face instruction with online learning activities. This approach allows for greater flexibility and personalization, catering to diverse learning styles and preferences.</p>
        <p>In a blended learning environment, students engage in both in-person and online learning experiences, leveraging the advantages of each modality. While face-to-face interactions facilitate collaboration, discussion, and hands-on activities, online components offer flexibility, accessibility, and opportunities for self-paced learning.</p>
        <p>Effective blended learning incorporates a thoughtful balance of online and in-person activities, seamless integration of technology, and clear communication of learning objectives and expectations. By following best practices for blended learning, educators can create dynamic and engaging learning experiences that promote student success.</p>
