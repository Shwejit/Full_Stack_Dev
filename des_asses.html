        <p>Key points to consider when designing assessments include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alignment with learning objectives:</strong> Assessments should align with the intended learning outcomes to ensure they accurately measure student achievement.</li>
            <li><strong>Validity and reliability:</strong> Assessments should be valid and reliable measures of student learning, providing accurate and consistent results.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear criteria and rubrics:</strong> Clear assessment criteria and rubrics help students understand expectations and provide consistent feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Authenticity and relevance:</strong> Assessments should reflect real-world tasks and contexts to enhance their authenticity and relevance.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback and reflection:</strong> Providing timely and constructive feedback allows students to reflect on their learning and make improvements.</li>
        </ul>
