            <h2>Definition of Active Learning</h2>
            <p>Active learning is a teaching method that promotes student engagement and success by encouraging students to actively participate in their own learning. It differs from traditional lecture-based instruction by emphasizing student interaction, problem-solving, and real-world application of course material.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Group Discussions</h3>
                    <p>Group discussions involve students working together in small groups to discuss a specific topic or question. This technique encourages active participation, critical thinking, and peer learning.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Problem-Based Learning</h3>
                    <p>Problem-based learning involves students working together to solve complex problems or real-world scenarios. This technique promotes active learning, collaboration, and the development of problem-solving skills.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Case Studies</h3>
                    <p>Case studies involve students analyzing real-world examples to identify patterns, trends, and solutions. This technique promotes active learning, critical thinking, and the development of analytical skills.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Simulations</h3>
                    <p>Simulations involve students participating in virtual or physical scenarios that simulate real-world situations. This technique promotes activelearning, engagement, and the development of practical skills.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Debates</h3>
                    <p>Debates involve students engaging in structured arguments about a specific topic. This technique promotes active learning, critical thinking, and the development of communication skills.</p>
